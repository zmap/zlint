[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/zmap/zlint)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/zmap/zlint)

ZLint is a golang-based X.509 certificate linter that checks for consistency
with [RFC 5280](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) and the CA/Browser Forum
Baseline Requirements
([v.1.4.8](https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/CA-Browser-Forum-BR-1.4.8.pdf)).

A detailed list of BR coverage can be found here:

Command Line Usage
------------------

ZLint can be used on the command-line through a simple bundled executable
_ZLint_ as well as through
[ZCertificate](https://github.com/zmap/zcertificate), a more full-fledged
command-line certificate parser that links against ZLint.

Example ZLint CLI usage:

	go get github.com/zmap/zlint/cmd/zlint
	zlint mycert.pem


Library Usage
-------------

ZLint can also be used as a library:


	import (
		"github.com/zmap/zcrypto/x509"
		"github.com/zmap/zlint"
	)

	parsed, err := x509.ParseCertificate(raw)
	if err != nil {
		// The certificate could not be parsed. Either error or halt.
		log.Errorf("could not parse certificate: %s", err)
	}
	zlintResult := zlint.LintCertificate(parsed)


See https://github.com/zmap/zlint/blob/master/cmd/zlint/main.go for an example.
