The following table details the acceptable AttributeTypes that may appear within the
type field of an AttributeTypeAndValue, as well as the contents permitted within the
value field.

+------------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Attribute Name   | Presence | Value                                                    | Verification    |
+------------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| organizationName | MUST     | The Subject’s name and/or DBA/tradename. The CA MAY      | Section 3.2.2.2 |
|                  |          | include information in this field that differs slightly  |                 |
|                  |          | from the verified name, such as common variations or     |                 |
|                  |          | abbreviations, provided that the CA documents the        |                 |
|                  |          | difference and any abbreviations used are locally        |                 |
|                  |          | accepted abbreviations; e.g. if the official record      |                 |
|                  |          | shows “Company Name Incorporated”, the CA MAY use        |                 |
|                  |          | “Company Name Inc.” or “Company Name”. If both are       |                 |
|                  |          | included, the DBA/tradename SHALL appear first, followed |                 |
|                  |          | by the Subject’s name in parentheses.                    |                 |
