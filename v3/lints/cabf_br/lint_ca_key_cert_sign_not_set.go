/************************************************
--- Citation History of this Requirement ---
v1 to v1.2.5: Appendix B ยง1(B) (roots) and ยง2(E) (subordinate CAs)
v1.3.0 to v1.8.7: 7.1.2.1b (roots) and ยง7.1.2.2e (subordinate CAs)
v2.0.0 to v2.1.7: 7.1.2.10.7

--- Version Notes ---
In v1.1.3, Appendix B's sections were numbered but retained their previous titles. "Root CA Certificate"
became section 1 and "Subordinate CA Certificate" became section 2. The numerical section references are
used here for all versions following the original document format of the Baseline Requirements.

This requirement was baselined at v2.1.7 and is current.

--- Requirements Language ---
BRs: 7.1.2 "Certificate Content and Extensions"
If the CA asserts compliance with these Baseline Requirements, all certificates that it issues MUST
comply with one of the following certificate profiles, which incorporate, and are derived from RFC 5280.

[Each of the CA profiles specifies the keyUsage extension follows section 7.1.2.10.7]

BRs: 7.1.2.10.7 "CA Certificate Key Usage"
+-------------+-----------+----------+
| Key Usage   | Permitted | Required |
+-------------+-----------+----------+
| keyCertSign | Y         | Y        |
+-------------+-----------+----------+
