--- Citation History of this Requirement ---
v1.4.8 to v1.8.7: 7.1.4.3.1a
v2.0.0 to v2.1.6: 7.1.2.10.2

--- Version Notes ---
As of v2.0.0, this requirement no longer applies to CA certificates that conform to the
Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate Profile. This lint does not implement this exemption
because it is impossible to identify certificates to which it applies from only the certificate.

This requirement was baselined at v2.1.6 and is current.

--- Requirements Language ---
BRs: 7.1.2
If the CA asserts compliance with these Baseline Requirements, all certificates that it issues MUST
comply with one of the following certificate profiles

[Each of the CA profiles, excepting the Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate Profile,
specifies the subject follows 7.1.2.10.2]

BRs: 7.1.2.10.2
The following table details the acceptable AttributeTypes that may appear within the type
field of an AttributeTypeAndValue, as well as the contents permitted within the value field.
+----------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| Attribute Name | Presence | Value                                                    | Verification   |
+----------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| commonName     | MUST     | The contents SHOULD be an identifier for the certificate |                |
|                |          | such that the certificateâ€™s Name is unique across all    |                |
|                |          | certificates issued by the issuing certificate.          |                |
