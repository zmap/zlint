ec_no_parameters_included | “EC keys must have parameters” (no parameters were included) | -
ec_off_curve | EC Public key MUST be on curve | -
edi_part_name_missing | Simply checks if the EDIPartyName field is present. No further tests are performed. | -
eku_extra_usage | Extended Key Usage should pertain only to TLS Web Server Authentication, TLS Web Client Authentication, and E-mail Protection. Everything else is a warning | -
encode_not_der | The certificate SHOULD be encoded in the DER format. | -
ext_explicit_false | critical:FALSE explicitly encoded (X.690) | -
ext_san_placed_first | Some python versions will not see SAN extension if it is the first extension | -
ext_unknown | Any unknown extension causes an error => what's unknown? is there a list?? | -
ext_unknown_crit | Any unknown or opaque extension that is marked as critical causes an error | -
ext_unsupported | Any extension from Netscape, Microsoft, or just unsupported is marked as opaque | -
iana_base_domain_underscore | SHOULD NOT contain underscore in base domain | -
iana_domain_not_qualified | MUST have qualified domain name | -
iana_special | SHOULD NOT be special name => what's a special name? | -
iana_tld_type_unknown | MUST have known type of TLD | -
iana_tld_unknown | MUST have known tld from list | -
pre_br_valid_too_long | Pre-BR certificates should not be more than 120 months in validity | -
registered_id_empty | Simply checks if the RegisteredID field is filled. No further tests are performed. | -

rfc822_name_invalid_padding | Checks to verify the validity of a RFC822 name field. Checking for invalid padding | -
rfc822_name_null_char | Checks to verify the validity of a RFC822 name field. Checking for null character | -
rsa_mod_is_negative | “RSA public key modulus must be positive” (negative modulus found) | -

rsa_no_param | “RSA keys must have a parameter specified” (no rsa parameter) | -
signature_algorithm_pss_not_supported | Checks if the signature algorithm is RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme. This is not supported by most browsers | -
signature_algorithm_weak | Compares chosen signature algorithm to list containing algs and their corresponding strength. A ‘weak’ alg should have at least 64 bits on entropy. A ‘good’ alg should have at least 20 bits | -
string_contains_null | If a null byte was found in a String (UTF8, Teletex, Videotex, Graphic, General) in a certificate element this error is thrown. UTF8 currently returns a separate error for this same error, condensed here. | -

string_teletext_encoded_incorrectly | Teletex strings found in a certificate element should be correctly encoded. | -
string_utf8_encoded_incorrectly | If an incorrectly encoded UTF8String is found, fatal error. This means that an element in the certificate failed: value.force_encoding('UTF-8').valid_encoding | -
